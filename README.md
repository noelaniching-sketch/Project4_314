# Project4_314

Social media is widely used, especially among young people.

Many studies suggest heavy social media use can increase stress or anxiety.

Instead of surveys, this project uses Google Trends search data to analyze real-world behavior.

Two search terms were analyzed:

“social media use”

“stress symptoms”

Goal: find trends, correlations, and prediction patterns in the data.
